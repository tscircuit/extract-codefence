The build command should be "tsup --format esm ./index.ts"

The package.json should have "files": ["dist"]

The first version will be 0.0.1


```tsx
export const extractCodefence = (text: string) => {
  const codefence = text.match(/```(tsx?|typescript)([\s\S]*?)```/)
  return codefence?.[2].trim()
}
```


```tsx
import { expect, test } from "bun:test"
import { extractCodefence } from "lib/extract-codefence"

test("extractCodefence", () => {
  expect(extractCodefence("```tsx\nconsole.log('hello')\n```")).toBe("console.log('hello')")
})
```  

Certainly! I'll set up the npm module "extract-codefence" with a great README, write the source code, and prepare the necessary files. I'll make changes to the existing files and create new ones as needed. Let's go through this step by step:

1. Update package.json:

package.json
<source>json

  "name": "extract-codefence",
  "module": "index.ts",
  "type": "module",
  "devDependencies": {

  "peerDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  }

2. Update index.ts with the provided code:

index.ts
<source>typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
console.log("Hello via Bun!");
=======
export const extractCodefence = (text: string) => {
  const codefence = text.match(/```(tsx?|typescript)([\s\S]*?)```/)
  return codefence?.[2].trim()
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</source>

3. Create a new file for tests:

test/extract-codefence.test.ts
<source>typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
import { expect, test } from "bun:test"
import { extractCodefence } from "../index"

test("extractCodefence", () => {
  expect(extractCodefence("```tsx\nconsole.log('hello')\n```")).toBe("console.log('hello')")
})
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</source>

4. Update README.md with a comprehensive guide:

README.md
<source>markdown
<<<<<<< SEARCH
# extract-codefence

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
=======
# extract-codefence

A lightweight utility to extract code from codefence blocks in markdown-like text.

## Installation

```bash
npm install extract-codefence
```

or if you're using Bun:

```bash
bun add extract-codefence
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { extractCodefence } from 'extract-codefence';

const markdownText = `
# Example

Here's some code:

\`\`\`tsx
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
\`\`\`
`;

const extractedCode = extractCodefence(markdownText);
console.log(extractedCode);
// Output: const greeting = "Hello, World!";
//         console.log(greeting);
```

## API

### extractCodefence(text: string): string | undefined

Extracts the code from the first codefence block in the given text.

- `text`: The input text containing codefence blocks.
- Returns: The extracted code as a string, or `undefined` if no codefence block is found.

## Development

To set up the project for development:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Run tests:

```bash
bun test
```

4. Build the project:

```bash
bun run build
```

Now that we've set up the project, here are some shell commands you might want to run:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run tests
bun test

# Build the project
bun run build
```

These commands will install the necessary dependencies, run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly, and build the project using the tsup bundler.
